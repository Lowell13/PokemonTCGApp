# PokemonTCGViewer

A Flutter application developed during classes to train. It allows you to display some Pokemon
cards from the official API https://pokemontcg.io and view details associated to each cards.

There is still a lot that can be done to improve it, but it's a nice start !

If you don't know which apk you should download, take the arm64 one. It's suited for 64-bit platform and is supported by most devices released since 2016.
If it doesn't work, then use the armeabi which is the 32-bit equivalent.

If none of them work, try the x86_64 one, but it's very uncommon and used for example by some Android emulators.
x86 is the platform use by Zenfone for example, and is currently not supported by Flutter.
